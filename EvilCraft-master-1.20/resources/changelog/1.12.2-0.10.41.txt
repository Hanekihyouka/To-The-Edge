As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 0.10.22 or higher.

Changes:
* Improve crafting of dead bushes using shears, Closes #617
  This fixes inconveniences and dupe bugs with other mods.
* Make the Eternal Water Block more powerful
  It will now output as much water as possible, not only 1 bucket per tick.
* Update zh_CN.lang

Fixes:
* Fix Vengeance Spirits ignoring the \kill command, Closes #635
* Fix Envir Acc losing color after world restart, Closes #637
* Fix Envir Acc beam hiding water, #631
* Fix dismounting from broom when shooting arrows, Closes #613
* Fix Exalted Crafter not rendering as entity, Closes #618
* Fix #622: make buckets fillable from Eternal Water Block
* Fix #620: stop werewolves transforming in sky light 0
* Fix lightning bolts not transforming werewolf villagers
  Turning villagers into werewolvians never actually worked right, because in
  vanilla, lightning turns villagers into witches, and it "wins". Rework it to
  have a 50% chance of making them witches like vanilla, and a 50% chance of
  making them werewolvians.
* Fix #614: make the eternal water bucket work on cauldrons
