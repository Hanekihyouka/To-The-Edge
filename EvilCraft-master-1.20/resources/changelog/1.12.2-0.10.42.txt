As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 0.10.24 or higher.

Fixes:
* Fix incorrect facing rendered for Blood Chest
* Don't always show vengeance spirits in creative mode
  When this was originally added, spectral glasses didn't exist. Now that they
  do, creative players can just get and use these to see spirits if they want.
  Fixes #632.



0.10.41 was pulled shortly after being pushed, because of an incompatibility with CyclopsCore.
A new version of CyclopsCore was released to resolve this, so this version adds a requirement on this new version.
Below you can find the original changelog for EvilCraft 0.10.41.

Changes:
* Improve crafting of dead bushes using shears, Closes #617
  This fixes inconveniences and dupe bugs with other mods.
* Make the Eternal Water Block more powerful
  It will now output as much water as possible, not only 1 bucket per tick.
* Update zh_CN.lang

Fixes:
* Fix Vengeance Spirits ignoring the \kill command, Closes #635
* Fix Envir Acc losing color after world restart, Closes #637
* Fix Envir Acc beam hiding water, #631
* Fix dismounting from broom when shooting arrows, Closes #613
* Fix Exalted Crafter not rendering as entity, Closes #618
* Fix #622: make buckets fillable from Eternal Water Block
* Fix #620: stop werewolves transforming in sky light 0
* Fix lightning bolts not transforming werewolf villagers
  Turning villagers into werewolvians never actually worked right, because in
  vanilla, lightning turns villagers into witches, and it "wins". Rework it to
  have a 50% chance of making them witches like vanilla, and a 50% chance of
  making them werewolvians.
* Fix #614: make the eternal water bucket work on cauldrons
