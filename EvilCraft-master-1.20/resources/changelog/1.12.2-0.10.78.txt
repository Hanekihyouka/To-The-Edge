As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 1.5.0 or higher.

Fixes:
* Fix Bound Blood Drop damage bar sometimes rendering weirdly
  This could occur when BM sets the orb level to a value below
  the current fill level.
  Closes CyclopsMC/EvilCraft#788
* Fix gui progress bars always showing some progress
* Fix stackable fluid containers voiding when draining into machines
  The items that won't fit anymore will pop into the world.
  This is a temporary measure that will be rewritten in the
  next major EC update.
  Closes #791
