As always, don't forget to backup your world before updating!
Requires CyclopsCore version 0.11.1 or higher.

Changes:
* Rebalance Undead Sapling recipe
  It now requires 800mB instead of 2000mB, so that it can serve as a more convenient way to generate Blood when combined with squeezing logs using third-party mods.
* Move Ender Tear dropping logic to loot tables, Closes #640
  This allows pack makers to more easily tweak or disable Ender Tear dropping.

Fixes:
* Fix fluid rendering too dark in tank and chalice
